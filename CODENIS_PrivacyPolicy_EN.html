    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how CODENIS (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile games and related services (collectively, the “Services”). By installing or using our games, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

      <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://codenis-site.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://codenis-site.vercel.app</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope of this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy covers information that is processed when you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Download and play our mobile games on Android or other platforms.</li>
      <li>View in-game ads delivered by our advertising partners.</li>
      <li>Interact with our in-game store, rewards, leaderboards, and game settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not directly collect information that personally identifies you (such as your real name, home address, email address, or phone number) inside our games. However, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain types of information when you use our Services.
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Information collected automatically</h3>
    <p>
      When you play our games, some information is automatically collected by the game and by third-party SDKs (such as Google AdMob). This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device information</strong> – device model, operating system version, language, system settings, screen resolution, and other technical details.</li>
      <li><strong>Identifiers</strong> – 
        <em>Google Advertising ID (GAID/AAID)</em> or similar advertising identifiers provided by the operating system, for the purpose of displaying and measuring advertisements.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> – coarse location derived from IP address (for example, country or region), used mainly for analytics, security, and to show relevant ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong> – game session length, in-game events (such as levels completed, items unlocked, buttons pressed), crash logs, and general interaction with in-game ads.</li>
      <li><strong>IP address</strong> – used by our partners for security, fraud prevention, and regional settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Information collected via third-party advertising and analytics</h3>
    <p>
      Our games may include software development kits (“SDKs”) from third-party partners such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – for displaying banner ads, interstitial (full-screen) ads, and rewarded video ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> – for basic platform functionality and, where applicable, leaderboards or achievements.</li>
      <li><strong>Unity / game engine services</strong> – for technical game functionality and diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These partners may collect and process information under their own privacy policies. We recommend you review their policies as well:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob &amp; Google Mobile Ads: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
      <li>Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How we use the information</h2>
    <p>
      We and our partners use the information described above for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To provide and operate our games</strong> – ensuring that the game runs correctly on your device and that core features (such as saving progress, in-game rewards, and difficulty) work as designed.</li>
      <li><strong>To display advertisements</strong> – showing ads, including rewarded video ads (for example, to grant in-game coins or items after watching an ad).</li>
      <li><strong>To analyze game performance</strong> – understanding which features are popular, improving stability, detecting crashes, and optimizing performance.</li>
      <li><strong>To prevent fraud and abuse</strong> – protecting our games and ad partners from fraudulent activity and misuse.</li>
      <li><strong>To comply with legal obligations</strong> – where processing is required by applicable laws and regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Advertising and Google AdMob</h2>
    <p>
      Our games may show ads provided by Google AdMob and its advertising partners. AdMob may use information such as your device’s advertising ID (AAID), IP address, approximate location, app usage data, and technical device information to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver ads within our games.</li>
      <li>Measure and improve ad performance.</li>
      <li>Detect fraudulent or invalid activity.</li>
      <li>Show personalized or non-personalized ads, depending on your settings and applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.1 Personalized vs. non-personalized ads</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on your region and settings, Google and its partners may show:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personalized ads</strong> – based on your interests, app usage, and other signals associated with your device or advertising ID.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-personalized ads</strong> – based only on context (such as the content of the game) and a limited use of information such as coarse location and basic device data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Where required by law (for example, under GDPR in the European Economic Area), Google may ask for your consent to show personalized ads. You may also receive only non-personalized ads in some cases, such as when consent is not granted or when child-appropriate treatment is required.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Google Advertising ID (AAID)</h3>
    <p>
      Our games and AdMob use the <strong>Google Advertising ID (AAID)</strong> to show and measure ads. You can reset or limit the use of the AAID in your device settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads (or “Privacy” / “Ads”) – here you can reset your advertising ID or limit ad personalization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Do we share or sell your data?</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal data for money. We may share certain technical data with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advertising partners</strong> (such as Google AdMob) – strictly for the purpose of delivering, measuring, and improving ads, as described above.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers</strong> – companies that help us operate our games (for example, analytics, crash reporting, or hosting), under appropriate data protection terms.</li>
      <li><strong>Authorities or legal entities</strong> – if we are required to do so by law, legal process, or to protect our rights, users, or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our games are designed for a general audience and are not primarily directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases where our games may be accessed by younger users:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We aim to limit data processing and to use child-appropriate ad settings where required.</li>
      <li>Ads may be non-personalized and based on contextual information only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided personal data to us, please contact us at <strong>enisermis11@gmail.com</strong>. We will promptly review and delete the information if necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We and our partners retain data only for as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing and improving our games.</li>
      <li>Complying with our legal obligations.</li>
      <li>Resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The exact retention period may vary depending on the data type and the partner’s policies (for example, AdMob’s retention rules).
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your rights and choices</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and local laws (such as GDPR in the EU or CCPA in California), you may have certain rights regarding your data, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access, correct, or delete certain data.</li>
      <li>The right to object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
      <li>The right to withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can also:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reset or limit the use of your advertising ID (AAID) in your device settings.</li>
      <li>Adjust your ad personalization preferences in your Google account settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you would like to exercise any rights or have questions about your data, please contact us at <strong>enisermis11@gmail.com</strong>. We may redirect you to our partners (such as Google) when they control the relevant data.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Data security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>11. International data transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Our games and third-party services may process data on servers located in different countries. By using our games, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our games, technologies, legal requirements, or business practices. When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly.
